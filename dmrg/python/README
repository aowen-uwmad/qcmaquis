This directory contains the old pydmrg/pyalps scripts that work with ALPS/QCMaquis HDF5 result files, but have been ported to Python 3
Since pyalps is not compatible with python 3, a replacement library (pyalpslite.py) has been written, which emulates the pyalps functions used in those scripts.
Note that for now, only scripts related to entanglement have been ported, and those loading energy and plotting sweeps have not been ported yet.
Old (not yet ported) Python 2 scripts can be found in the legacy/ subdirectory, but keep in mind that they need Python 2 and a functioning pyalps installation.
