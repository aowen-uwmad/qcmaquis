Experimental branch:
Diverged from trunk from revision 2921.

Scripts usage:
Add the bootstrap to your bin by symlinking 
(or by adding ./common to your PATH):
 
ln -s common/maquis ~/bin/maquis

Now you should be able to use command `maquis` as following:

maquis [ -s dir ] [ -e ] [ config ]

-s : sources directory (including scripts folder)
     if not provided - searches for $MAQUIS_ROOT
     and if not set - will search back from `pwd`
     
-e : sets the environment according to [ config ]

After execution with defined [ config ] 
one will be able to execute:

     run [ binary ] [ params / preset ]
     build [ targets ]
     configure [ targets ]
     clean [ targets ]
     test [ targets ]
     benchmark [ targets ]
     envset

If [ config ] is not present - you will need to 
add config name before the command name, i.e:

     <config> build [ targets ]

Note: 
1) the environment is propagated unless purged.
2) run command specifically looks for:
   - VALGRIND
   - CILK_NUM_THREADS
   - OMP_NUM_THREADS
   - MPI_NUM_PROCS

Example:
$ cd ~/experimental/src
$ maquis -e ambient_intel_openmpi
$ build dmrg
$ MPI_NUM_PROCS=2 OMP_NUM_THREADS=6 run dmrg large

The `run` command above will automatically look for `dmrg` binary 
in the build dir and execute it with parameters from "large" preset.
Encountering MPI and OMP variables it will pin 6 threads of every 
processes onto separate sockets.
