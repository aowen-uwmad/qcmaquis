Dataflow paradigm through object versioning in C++

At the moment there is a rise of demand for the software programming paradigms that would allow scientists and programmers to effectively utilize distributed multi-core hardware resources. This demand is stimulated by the complexity of the existing approaches to parallel programming where one has to micromanage all simultaneous execution processes.

Instead of proposing a new language or complicated constructions, this research focuses on evolving existing C++ programming paradigm to allow its utilisation in distributed/shared-memory execution environments.

Without any significant altering of the programming techniques we blend dataflow paradigm into the mix of paradigms used with C++. It is done by implementing a versioning system for the run-time objects and delaying operations execution. As a consequence the application execution can be represented as an asynchronous parallel traversal of a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) avoiding any race conditions and automatically transferring dependencies between the operations through the underlying interconnect.

As a proof of concept, I will also present the results of parallelisation for the Density Matrix Renormalisation Group application and implementation of the parallel linear algebra operations that were used in the process.
