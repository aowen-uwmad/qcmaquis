There are two application codes.

-High temperature series expansion: high_t_expansion_testcode.cpp
    This code uses (large) integers

-T=0 perturbative series expansion: zero_expansion_testcode.cpp
    This code uses rational numbers based on (large) integers.



There are two parameters which change the performance drastically:

-maximal order: the order of the expansion.
    can be modified using the MAXORDER macro
    (we aim at a maximal order of 17 to 20)

-graph size: number of vertices of the graph for which the computation is done.
    can be modified by adding edges to new vertices (in main()) to the graph g
    (The number of vertices will typically correspond to the maximal order
     and we will have several thoundands of graphs like that.)



A typical 'sparse matrix' is defined in operators.hpp as a function that
transforms the vector it gets as argument.
